            "preliminary_formulas": "To enhance the modeling of the Great Lakes hydrological system, we must adopt a more comprehensive approach that integrates variability and uncertainty into the conservation of mass equations. We begin by defining the volume of water in each lake as a function of time, \\( V_i(t) \\), and consider the differential change in volume through a refined equation that incorporates dynamic inflow and outflow rates, as well as temporally and spatially variable precipitation and evaporation. The equation is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dV_i(t)}{dt} = Q_{\\text{in},i}(t) - Q_{\\text{out},i}(t) + \\left(P_i(t) + \\Delta P_i(t)\\right) \\cdot A_i - \\left(E_i(t) + \\Delta E_i(t)\\right) \\cdot A_i + S_i(t)\n\\]\n\nIn this formulation, \\( Q_{\\text{in},i}(t) \\) and \\( Q_{\\text{out},i}(t) \\) represent the inflow and outflow rates, respectively, in cubic meters per second. The terms \\( P_i(t) \\) and \\( E_i(t) \\) denote the baseline precipitation and evaporation rates, while \\( \\Delta P_i(t) \\) and \\( \\Delta E_i(t) \\) account for stochastic variations due to climatic changes, captured using probabilistic climate models. The surface area \\( A_i \\) of each lake is in square meters. The addition of a source term \\( S_i(t) \\) allows for the incorporation of anthropogenic or ecological factors influencing water levels, such as water withdrawals for municipal use or ecological flows needed for habitat maintenance. This term is crucial for reflecting socio-economic and environmental dynamics.\n\nThe model further accounts for inter-lake dependencies through coupled equations, where the outflow from one lake serves as the inflow for another. For instance, the outflow from Lake Erie, influenced by diversions and natural flow through the Niagara and Welland rivers, is modeled as:\n\n\\[\nQ_{\\text{out, Erie}}(t) = Q_{\\text{Niagara}}(t) + Q_{\\text{Welland}}(t) + \\Delta Q_{\\text{out, Erie}}(t)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\Delta Q_{\\text{out, Erie}}(t) \\) captures variability in outflow due to regulatory changes or extreme weather events. This formulation feeds into the inflow of Lake Ontario:\n\n\\[\nQ_{\\text{in, Ontario}}(t) = Q_{\\text{Niagara}}(t) + \\Delta Q_{\\text{in, Ontario}}(t)\n\\]\n\nBoundary conditions are established using initial water volumes derived from historical datasets, which are adjusted for potential discrepancies and biases through data assimilation techniques. Advanced numerical methods, such as adaptive finite element analysis, are employed to solve this system of equations, allowing for high-resolution simulations that dynamically adjust to changing input conditions. This approach not only maintains dimensional consistency but also enhances the model's adaptability and scalability. By incorporating variability, stochastic elements, and anthropogenic factors, the model provides a more holistic and realistic representation of the Great Lakes system, offering valuable insights for water management and policy decisions under changing environmental and socio-economic conditions. Validation against historical and real-time data ensures the model's reliability, while its flexible structure supports the integration of new data and insights, facilitating ongoing refinement and application across diverse scenarios.",
            "mathematical_modeling_process": "In continuing the modeling formula section, we delve deeper into each component of the equation to thoroughly understand the dynamics of the Great Lakes hydrological system. The primary equation, \\( \\frac{dV_i(t)}{dt} = Q_{\\text{in},i}(t) - Q_{\\text{out},i}(t) + \\left(P_i(t) + \\Delta P_i(t)\\right) \\cdot A_i - \\left(E_i(t) + \\Delta E_i(t)\\right) \\cdot A_i + S_i(t) \\), serves as the foundation for modeling the conservation of mass in each lake. Here, \\( V_i(t) \\) represents the volume of water in each lake as a function of time, highlighting the dynamic nature of the system. The inflow rate \\( Q_{\\text{in},i}(t) \\) and outflow rate \\( Q_{\\text{out},i}(t) \\) are critical parameters, expressed in cubic meters per second, which capture the movement of water into and out of the lakes. These rates are influenced by both natural processes, such as rainfall and river discharge, and controlled interventions, such as water management policies. \n\nPrecipitation \\( P_i(t) \\) and evaporation \\( E_i(t) \\) are baseline values that represent average climatic conditions over the lake's surface area \\( A_i \\). To account for the inherent variability in these processes due to changing weather patterns and climate change, stochastic components \\( \\Delta P_i(t) \\) and \\( \\Delta E_i(t) \\) are introduced. These variations are modeled through probabilistic climate models, which provide a range of possible scenarios to better capture the uncertainty in future climatic conditions. The effective precipitation and evaporation, therefore, become \\( (P_i(t) + \\Delta P_i(t)) \\) and \\( (E_i(t) + \\Delta E_i(t)) \\) respectively, enhancing the model's robustness by including potential deviations from the norm.\n\nThe source term \\( S_i(t) \\) plays a vital role in incorporating anthropogenic and ecological impacts, such as water withdrawals for municipal use, industrial activities, and the need for ecological flows to support local ecosystems. This term can be tailored to reflect the socio-economic and environmental dynamics specific to each lake, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of human-environment interactions.\n\nA key aspect of the model is the coupling of equations to reflect inter-lake dependencies. For example, the outflow from Lake Erie, which consists of natural flow through the Niagara and Welland rivers, is expressed as \\( Q_{\\text{out, Erie}}(t) = Q_{\\text{Niagara}}(t) + Q_{\\text{Welland}}(t) + \\Delta Q_{\\text{out, Erie}}(t) \\). The variability in this outflow, captured by \\( \\Delta Q_{\\text{out, Erie}}(t) \\), accounts for regulatory changes or extreme weather events that may disrupt normal flow patterns. This outflow then becomes the inflow for Lake Ontario, adjusted for variability with \\( Q_{\\text{in, Ontario}}(t) = Q_{\\text{Niagara}}(t) + \\Delta Q_{\\text{in, Ontario}}(t) \\), ensuring continuity and conservation of mass across the system.\n\nBoundary conditions are crucial for initializing the model, and they are set using historical water volume data, which is refined through data assimilation techniques to reconcile discrepancies and biases. Advanced numerical methods, particularly adaptive finite element analysis, are employed to solve the system of coupled differential equations. This approach allows for high-resolution simulations that can dynamically adjust to changing input conditions, thus maintaining the dimensional consistency of the model while offering the flexibility needed to incorporate new data and insights. Overall, this detailed exploration of the modeling formula provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex water dynamics of the Great Lakes system, offering valuable insights for water management and policy decisions in the face of changing environmental and socio-economic conditions.",

            "preliminary_formulas": "To develop a more refined predictive model for the Great Lakes system, it's crucial to address the complexities inherent in hydrological data and the environmental dynamics affecting these water bodies. The first step involves enhancing the time series models to better capture the non-linear and spatially heterogeneous characteristics of the data. Instead of relying solely on ARIMA, integrating hybrid models like SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) can account for seasonal variations, which are significant in hydrological data. The SARIMA model can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \nX_t = \\phi_1 X_{t-1} + \\phi_2 X_{t-2} + \\cdots + \\phi_p X_{t-p} + \\Phi_1 X_{t-s} + \\Phi_2 X_{t-2s} + \\cdots + \\Phi_P X_{t-Ps} + \\theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\theta_2 \\epsilon_{t-2} + \\cdots + \\theta_q \\epsilon_{t-q} + \\Theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-s} + \\Theta_2 \\epsilon_{t-2s} + \\cdots + \\Theta_Q \\epsilon_{t-Qs} + \\epsilon_t \n\\]\n\nwhere \\( X_t \\) represents the observed data, \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\theta \\) are the autoregressive and moving average coefficients, \\( \\Phi \\) and \\( \\Theta \\) are seasonal counterparts, \\( s \\) is the seasonal period, and \\( \\epsilon_t \\) is the error term. This model allows for capturing both regular and seasonal dynamics, offering a more nuanced understanding of inflow and outflow rates as well as lake levels.\n\nMoreover, incorporating spatial considerations through multivariate models like VAR (Vector Autoregression) can enhance predictions by considering interdependencies between different lakes and rivers. The VAR model can be formulated as:\n\n\\[ \nY_t = A_1 Y_{t-1} + A_2 Y_{t-2} + \\cdots + A_p Y_{t-p} + \\epsilon_t \n\\]\n\nwhere \\( Y_t \\) is a vector of the hydrological parameters across different locations, \\( A_i \\) are coefficient matrices, and \\( \\epsilon_t \\) is the error vector. This approach allows for modeling interactions between various hydrological components, considering spatial heterogeneity and improving prediction accuracy.\n\nIn addition to traditional time series models, employing advanced neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in conjunction with LSTMs can capture both spatial and temporal dependencies. This hybrid model can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \nH_t = \\text{CNN}(X_t) + \\text{LSTM}(H_{t-1}, X_t; W, U)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( H_t \\) is the hidden state, \\( X_t \\) is the input data, \\( W \\) and \\( U \\) are weight matrices, and the CNN component processes spatial features while the LSTM captures temporal dependencies. This structure is well-suited for handling complex patterns in hydrological data, enabling robust predictions that account for both spatial variability and temporal dynamics.\n\nScenario analysis benefits from the integration of stochastic modeling techniques like Bayesian networks, which provide a probabilistic framework for evaluating uncertainties and variability in environmental conditions. Bayesian networks allow for the incorporation of prior knowledge and continuous updating of predictions as new data becomes available. The likelihood of various scenarios can be computed using Bayes' theorem:\n\n\\[ \nP(H | D) = \\frac{P(D | H) \\cdot P(H)}{P(D)}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( P(H | D) \\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \\( H \\) given data \\( D \\), \\( P(D | H) \\) is the likelihood, \\( P(H) \\) is the prior probability, and \\( P(D) \\) is the evidence. This approach facilitates dynamic scenario analysis, offering probabilistic insights into potential outcomes under different environmental conditions.\n\nBy integrating these advanced modeling techniques, the framework not only captures the intricate dynamics of the Great Lakes system but also provides actionable insights that support adaptive water management strategies.

This involves updating the model parameters periodically as new data emerges, thus maintaining the model's relevance and accuracy over time. Additionally, the incorporation of VAR (Vector Autoregression) models is essential for capturing the spatial interdependencies between the lakes and rivers in the Great Lakes system. By treating the hydrological parameters at different locations as a multivariate time series, the VAR model can predict how changes in one part of the system might affect others, thereby providing a comprehensive spatial understanding of water dynamics.\n\nTo further enhance predictive capabilities, the integration of neural network architectures, particularly CNNs combined with LSTMs, provides a robust framework for capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. The CNN component is designed to extract spatial features from gridded climate data, such as precipitation and temperature maps, while the LSTM captures the temporal evolution of these features over time. This hybrid approach allows the model to learn complex patterns and interactions that traditional statistical models might miss, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness to non-linearities and sudden changes in the data. The scenario analysis component leverages stochastic modeling techniques, such as Bayesian networks, to evaluate the potential impacts of various environmental scenarios, including climate change and extreme weather events. By representing uncertainties probabilistically, Bayesian networks facilitate the continuous updating of predictions as new data becomes available, providing a dynamic and flexible framework for scenario analysis.\n\nIn practice, the integration of these predictive models with scenario analysis involves several assumptions, including the reliability and completeness of historical data and the accuracy of climate models. The stochastic components introduced in the models allow for the quantification of uncertainties, providing probabilistic forecasts that inform adaptive management strategies. For instance, by simulating different climate scenarios, stakeholders can assess the potential impacts on inflow and outflow rates, lake levels, and other hydrological parameters, thereby enabling proactive decision-making processes that anticipate and mitigate risks associated with unexpected environmental changes or data inaccuracies. This approach ensures that the model remains adaptable and resilient, capable of providing actionable insights that support dynamic and informed water management strategies. Ultimately, the integration of predictive modeling and scenario analysis provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing the complex dynamics of the Great Lakes system, aligning with ecological and socio-economic objectives while addressing the challenges of forecasting under uncertainty.",

This involves employing advanced techniques like Monte Carlo simulations and variance-based methods to quantify uncertainties and explore the probabilistic effects of variability on model predictions. The sensitivity analysis begins with defining critical parameters and their respective probability distributions, informed by empirical data and expert knowledge. For instance, inflow and outflow rates might be modeled as stochastic variables with normal or log-normal distributions, capturing the inherent variability in these hydrological processes. Precipitation levels could be treated similarly, with adjustments to account for spatial and temporal variations across the Great Lakes region. Monte Carlo simulations are then conducted by generating a large number of random samples from these distributions, allowing the model to simulate a wide range of possible scenarios and assess their impact on key outcomes, such as lake water levels and ecological health indices.\n\nThe results of the sensitivity analysis are further refined using variance decomposition techniques, which help identify the most influential parameters by quantifying their direct and interaction effects on model outputs. This is typically expressed through sensitivity indices, which offer insights into which variables are most critical in driving changes in the model's predictions. Armed with this information, the model can be calibrated to improve its accuracy and reliability, focusing on the parameters that most significantly affect performance indicators like water level accuracy and stakeholder satisfaction metrics. Concurrently, an iterative methodology is employed to continuously refine the model based on new empirical data and insights, ensuring it remains responsive to evolving environmental and socio-economic conditions. This involves updating parameter distributions and model structure as new information becomes available, maintaining the model's relevance and adaptability over time.\n\nStakeholder engagement forms a crucial component of this task, requiring structured consultations and workshops to gather feedback, build trust, and facilitate collaborative decision-making processes. This is achieved through participatory modeling sessions, where stakeholders can express their preferences and concerns, which are then incorporated into a multi-criteria decision analysis framework. The objective function in this framework is designed to balance quantitative performance metrics with qualitative feedback, using weighted criteria to reflect stakeholder priorities. This dual-component approach ensures that the model aligns with stakeholder needs and fosters an inclusive and transparent water management strategy. Advanced tools like Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and decision support systems are utilized to visualize data and communicate findings effectively, enhancing stakeholder understanding and engagement.\n\nOverall, the refined modeling approach for Subtask 4 integrates sensitivity analysis with stakeholder engagement, ensuring that the model is both theoretically sound and practically relevant. By addressing potential uncertainties and maintaining stakeholder involvement, the model offers actionable insights for sustainable water management strategies in the Great Lakes region. This comprehensive framework aligns technical precision with socio-political acceptance, enabling a balanced and adaptive strategy for managing the complex dynamics of the Great Lakes system. The underlying assumptions include the availability of high-quality historical data and the accuracy of predictive models from earlier tasks, with external factors like policy changes and climate variability considered as potential influences on the task's execution and outcomes. The successful completion of Subtask 4 depends on effectively managing these elements, providing a robust, adaptable, and stakeholder-aligned model that supports informed decision-making and long-term ecological and economic health in the Great Lakes region.",

    "problem_background": "The Great Lakes of the United States and Canada are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world. The five lakes and connecting waterways constitute a massive drainage basin that contains many large urban areas in these two countries, with varied climate and localized weather conditions. The lakes’ water is used for many purposes (fishing, recreation, power generation, drinking, shipping, animal and fish habitat, construction, irrigation, etc.). Consequently, a vast variety of stakeholders have an interest in the management of the water that flows into and out of the lakes. In particular, if too little water is drained or evaporates from the lakes, then flooding may occur and homes and businesses along the shore suffer; if too much water is drained, then large ships cannot travel through the waterways to bring supplies and support the local economy. The main problem is regulating the water levels such that all stakeholders can benefit. The water level in each lake is determined by how much water enters and leaves the lake. These levels are the result of complex interactions among temperature, wind, tides, precipitation, evaporation, bathymetry (the shape of the lake bottom), river flows and runoff, reservoir policies, seasonal cycles, and long-term climate changes. There are two primary control mechanisms within the flow of water in the Great Lakes system – Compensating Works of the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie (three hydropower plants, five navigation locks, and a gated dam at the head of the rapids) and the Moses-Saunders Dam at Cornwall as indicated in the Addendum. While the two control dams, many channels and canals, and the drainage basin reservoirs may be controlled by humans, the rates of rain, evaporation, erosion, ice jams, and other water-flow phenomena are beyond human manipulation. The policies of local jurisdictions may have different effects than expected, as can seasonal and environmental changes in the water basin. These changes in turn affect the ecosystem of the area, which impacts the health of the flora and fauna found in and around the lakes and the residents that live in the water basin. Even though the Great Lakes seem to have a regular annual pattern, a variance from normal of two to three feet of water level can dramatically affect some of the stakeholders. This dynamic network flow problem is “wicked” – exceptionally challenging to solve because of interdependencies, complicated requirements, and inherent uncertainties. For the lake’s problems, we have ever-changing dynamics and the conflicting interests of stakeholders.",
    "problem_requirement": "The International Joint Commission (IJC) requests support from your company, International network Control Modelers – ICM, to assist with management and models for the control mechanisms (the two dams – Compensating Works and Moses-Saunders Dam as indicated in the Addendum) that directly influence water levels in the Great Lakes flow network. Your ICM supervisor has given your team the lead in developing the model and a management plan to implement the model. Your supervisor indicates there are several considerations that may help to achieve this goal starting with the building of a network model for the Great Lakes and connecting river flows from Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean. Some other optional considerations or issues your supervisor mentioned were: 1. Determination of the optimal water levels of the five Great Lakes at any time of the year, taking into account the various stakeholders’ desires (the costs and benefits could be different for each stakeholder). 2. Establishment of algorithms to maintain optimal water levels in the five lakes from inflow and outflow data for the lakes. 3. Understanding of the sensitivity of your control algorithms for the outflow of the two control dams. Given the data for 2017, would your new controls result in satisfactory or better than the actual recorded water levels for the various stakeholders for that year? 4. How sensitive is your algorithm to changes in environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation, winter snowpack, ice jams)? 5. Focus your extensive analysis of ONLY the stakeholders and factors influencing Lake Ontario as there is more recent concern for the management of the water level for this lake. The IJC is also interested in what historical data you use to inform your models and establish parameters, as they are curious to compare how your management and control strategies compare to previous models.

    "problem_analysis": "The management of water levels in the Great Lakes system presents a multifaceted challenge that requires a thorough and nuanced understanding of the hydrological, environmental, and socio-economic dynamics at play. This problem is characterized by a complex interplay of natural phenomena such as precipitation, evaporation, and climate change, alongside anthropogenic factors like dam operations and water usage policies. To address these challenges, the model must integrate a wide array of data sources and predictive algorithms, ensuring that the diverse and often conflicting interests of stakeholders are effectively balanced. Stakeholders, ranging from environmental conservationists to economic sectors dependent on shipping and recreational activities, have varied priorities that necessitate a flexible and adaptive modeling approach. The model should account for upstream and downstream interdependencies, acknowledging the potential for cascading effects that might arise from policy changes or natural events in one part of the system affecting another. By incorporating scenario analysis, the model can simulate different environmental conditions—such as varying precipitation levels or changes in temperature—to understand their impact on water levels and stakeholder interests. This approach allows for proactive management strategies that can mitigate risks associated with unexpected environmental changes or data inaccuracies.\n\nTo ensure robustness, the model must be grounded in a comprehensive dataset that includes both historical and real-time data, allowing for the calibration and validation of predictive algorithms. Emphasizing the importance of sensitivity analysis, the model should explore how variations in key parameters, such as inflow and outflow rates or stakeholder priorities, influence outcomes. This analysis will help identify critical thresholds and guide decision-making processes to maintain optimal water levels. Furthermore, the model should adopt an iterative and dynamic methodology, continuously refining its parameters and structure as new data and insights emerge. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining the model's relevance in the face of evolving environmental and socio-economic conditions.\n\nIn addition to technical considerations, the model must also engage with the broader socio-economic and ecological context of the Great Lakes region. By integrating insights from previous research and developments in the field, the model can leverage established benchmarks and methodologies to enhance its predictive accuracy and stakeholder engagement. Ethical considerations, such as the equitable distribution of water resources and the preservation of ecological health, should guide the model's design and implementation. By prioritizing transparency and stakeholder consultation, the model can build trust and facilitate collaborative decision-making processes that accommodate a wide range of interests and perspectives. Ultimately, the model aims to provide a comprehensive and adaptable framework for managing the Great Lakes' water levels, ensuring that all stakeholders can benefit from its outcomes while safeguarding the ecological integrity and economic vitality of this critical freshwater system."
