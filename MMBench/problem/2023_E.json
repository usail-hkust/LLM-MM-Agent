  "background": "Light pollution is used to describe any excessive or poor use of artificial light. Some of the phenomena that we refer to as light pollution include light trespass, over-illumination, and light clutter. These phenomena are most easily observed as a glow in the sky after the sun has set in large cities; however, they may also occur in more remote regions. Light pollution alters our view of the night sky, has environmental impacts and affects our health and safety. For example, plant maturation may be delayed or accelerated, and migration patterns of wildlife affected. Excessive artificial light may confuse our circadian rhythms, leading to poor sleep quality and perhaps physical and mental health issues. Glare caused by artificial lights may contribute to some motor vehicle accidents. Community officials or local groups may implement intervention strategies to mitigate the negative effects of light pollution. Artificial light, however, has both positive and negative effects that impact different locations in different ways. For example, to avoid the negative impacts of light pollution listed above, some communities opt for low-light neighborhoods which in turn might lead to increased crime. The impacts of light pollution may depend on factors such as the location’s level of development, population, biodiversity, geography, and climate. Therefore, assessing the extent of the effects and the potential impacts of any intervention strategies must be tailored to a specific location.",
  "problem_requirement": "COMAP’s Illumination Control Mission (ICM) is working to promote awareness of the impacts of light pollution and develop intervention strategies to mitigate those impacts. In support of this ICM work, your task is to address measuring and mitigating the effects of light pollution in various locations, incorporating both human and non-human concerns. Specifically, you should: 1. Develop a broadly applicable metric to identify the light pollution risk level of a location. 2. Apply your metric and interpret its results on the following four diverse types of locations: a protected land location, a rural community, a suburban community, and an urban community. 3. Describe three possible intervention strategies to address light pollution. Discuss specific actions to implement each strategy and the potential impacts of these actions on the effects of light pollution in general. 4. Choose two of your locations and use your metric to determine which of your intervention strategies is most effective for each of them. Discuss how the chosen intervention strategy impacts the risk level for the location. 5. Finally, for one of your identified locations and its most-effective intervention strategy, produce a 1-page flyer to promote the strategy for that location.",
