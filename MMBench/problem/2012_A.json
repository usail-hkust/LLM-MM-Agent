Consider and answer the following:\n\nWhy do leaves have the various shapes that they have?\nDo the shapes \"minimize\" overlapping individual shadows that are cast, so as to maximize exposure? Does the distribution of leaves within the \"volume\" of the tree and its branches effect the shape?\nSpeaking of profiles, is leaf shape (general characteristics) related to tree profile/branching structure?\nHow would you estimate the leaf mass of a tree? Is there a correlation between the leaf mass and the size characteristics of the tree (height, mass, volume defined by the profile)?",
