  "background": "The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is facing a decreasing number of bids to host the Olympics – both Summer and Winter Games[1]. In the past, hosting the Olympics was highly competitive and prestigious. More recently, however, host cities/nations have experienced a variety of short- and long-term negative impacts. To address these issues, innovative problem solvers are considering various options and strategies. For example, perhaps the Summer and Winter Games should each have a permanent location. Another idea is to split the Olympic sports into four (instead of two) groups and hold four smaller Olympic Games (e.g., Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall). This system might somewhat relieve the burden of hosting such a large event.",
  "problem_requirement": "COMAP’s Interdisciplinary Committee on Modern Games (ICMG) is interested in exploring creative options, strategies, and policies to ensure the Olympics are successful and continue to bring the world together through sport. Your task is to make recommendations in support of the ICMG’s work. The ICMG recommends building metrics for the impacts of hosting the games from various points of view: economic, land use, human satisfaction (athletes and spectators), travel, opportunity for future improvements, host city/nation prestige, and other criteria your team identifies. Consider the feasibility, timeline to implement, and impact of potential strategies on your metrics. Write a one-page memorandum to the IOC describing your strategy and policy recommendations.",
