  "background": "Wherever there are recreational sandy ocean beaches in the world, there seem to be children (and adults) creating sandcastles on the seashore. Using tools, toys, and imagination, beach goers create sandcastles that range from simple mounds of sand to complicated replicas of actual castles with walls, towers, moats, and other features that mimic real castles. In all these, one typically forms an initial foundation consisting of a single, nondescript mound of wetted sand, and then proceeds to cut and shape this base into a recognizable 3-dimensional geometric shape upon which to build the more castle-defining features.\n\nInevitably, the inflow of ocean waves coupled with rising tides erodes sandcastles. It appears, however, that not all sandcastles react the same way to waves and tides, even if built roughly the same size and at roughly the same distance from the water on the same beach. Consequently, one wonders if there exists a best 3-dimensional geometric shape to use for a sandcastle foundation.",
  "problem_requirement": "1. Construct a mathematical model to identify the best 3-dimensional geometric shape to use as a sandcastle foundation that will last the longest period of time on a seashore that experiences waves and tides under the following conditions:\n\nbuilt at roughly the same distance from the water on the same beach, and\nbuilt using the same type of sand, roughly the same amount of sand, and the same water-to-sand proportion.\n2. Using your model, determine an optimal sand-to-water mixture proportion for the castle foundation, assuming you use no other additives or materials (e.g. plastic or wooden supports, stones, etc.).\n\n3. Adjust your model as needed to determine how the best 3-dimensional sandcastle foundation you identified in requirement 1 is affected by rain, and whether it remains the best 3-dimensional geometric shape to be used as a castle foundation when it is raining.\n\n4. What other strategies, if any, might you use to make your sandcastle last longer?\n\n5. Finally, write an informative, one- to two-page article describing your model and its results for publication in the vacation magazine: Fun in the Sun, whose readers are mainly non-technical. ",
