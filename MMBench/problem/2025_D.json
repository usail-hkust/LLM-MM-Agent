    "background": "Transportation systems can help or harm a city’s growth and the lives of its residents. A successful transportation infrastructure can attract businesses, schools, tourists, and new residents. The transportation challenges that cities face are complex and intertwined. The various stakeholders (city residents, business owners, suburban residents, commuters, passthrough travelers, tourists, etc.) have different needs and priorities within those systems. Often one element or component of a transportation system favors one stakeholder over others therefore creating an interference with other needs of the system. Highways, bus routes, and rail systems can interfere with local city bikers and pedestrians and vice versa when vehicle drivers are delayed by city walkways and traffic lights. Sometimes, the biggest obstacle to effective transportation systems is the city’s geography – water (rivers, harbors, streams, drainage runoff) or landforms (hills, ditches, valleys, slopes). Even soil composition and weather conditions can be disruptive.\n\nBaltimore, Maryland, USA is a city affected by aging infrastructure and limited transportation options that impact people’s lives and hinder its economic growth. Adding to that is the recent collapse of a major bridge (Francis Scott Key Bridge) closing a major highway across its busy harbor. Baltimore has been making plans to improve its transportation network through infrastructure improvement and enhancing its public transportation as a part of its sustainability goals. These goals are based upon identifying, prioritizing, and implementing initiatives such as collaboration between stakeholders, maintaining or updating its physical systems, using data more effectively, and seeking technological advancements that enhance the lives of its residents and visitors.\n\nBaltimore has a bustling port and shipping center along with being located on a major interstate highway (I-95). Several of its passthrough and commuter highways and rail lines block or interfere with streets and neighborhoods making it difficult for city residents to access job opportunities in the shipping industries and for local businesses to transport goods into and around neighborhoods. Through planning initiatives to repair roads, build bypasses, expand public transit options, and improve access to ports and airports, Baltimore hopes to facilitate commerce and make the city a better place to live, work, and visit.\n\nRecently, through national funding and support, US cities have developed infrastructure plans to remove highways that divide neighborhoods into their downtown areas and seek to replace them in ways that reconnect and revitalize those areas. While the highways allow suburban residents to commute downtown or across the city to their jobs, urban neighborhoods were separated or destroyed in the construction of these highways. Baltimore hopes to reconnect these communities and provide more sustainable communities with more green spaces, better public housing, and opportunities for community entertainment and recreation. As examples, four transportation issues are outlined in these references: 1. The rebuilding of a collapsed bridge (Francis Scott Key Bridge) in the Harbor.[1] 2. The inadequacy of the minimal public rail systems (MARC, light rail, heavy rail), which connect suburbs that already have several transportation options. The rail transits are not substantial enough to enable commuters and residents to easily use the system to get to the workplace and the downtown free buses primarily help tourists and not the residents of intercity communities.[2] 3. Planning for fixing the disruption over decades on urban communities by US-40 (Highway to Nowhere) through the collaborative West Baltimore United Project.[3] 4. A travelogue of a resident of Brooklyn (community in Baltimore) and his ordeal of trying to use buses to get home after attending a football game in the city.[4]",
    "problem_requirement": "All of Baltimore’s transportation plans affect multiple stakeholders with differing perspectives. Your team’s assignment is to improve the lives of the city’s residents by recommending ways to improve Baltimore’s transportation network.\n\nA file with vehicle counts on street segments is provided. Creating transportation networks for Baltimore or one of its areas and communities will help you visualize and understand the issues. Therefore, you should build a network model(s) for some part or element of Baltimore’s transportation system.\n\nUsing your model, consider projects related to these transportation issues:\n\n1. The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge had a large impact on the transportation system of Baltimore. What does your network model(s) show is the impact of the bridge collapse and/or the reconstruction of the bridge? Be sure to highlight the impacts on the various stakeholders in and around Baltimore.\n\n2. Many residents of the City of Baltimore walk or travel by bus. Select a project or potential project that impacts the bus or pedestrian walkway systems. What does your network model(s) show is the impact of this project? Be sure to highlight the impacts on the various stakeholders in and around Baltimore.\n\n3. Recommend a project for the transportation network that best improves the lives of the residents of Baltimore.\n   a. What are the benefits to residents of this project?\n   b. How does your project impact other stakeholders?\n   c. Explain the ways that your project disrupts other transportation needs and people’s lives.\n\nShare Your Insights:\n\nSafety is a significant issue facing the City of Baltimore. How can the transportation system be used to best address this issue? Write a one-page memo to the Mayor of Baltimore describing two of your projects, including the benefits and drawbacks on the people and their safety in the city.",

    "addendum": "Real data, like that in the sets provided, is often quite messy. For example, many roads in Baltimore not only have a route number identifying them, but also a street name that may change from one section to another. Therefore, the data will require manipulation. Decisions and assumptions about how to manipulate the data are an important part of the modeling process. Moreover, teams are not limited to these data.\n\nThere are many valuable data sets available at: https://baltometro.org/about-us/datamaps/regional-gis-data-center and https://opendata.baltimorecountymd.gov/\n\nReferences:\n1.
