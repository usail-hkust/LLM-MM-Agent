  "background": "In the online marketplace it created, Amazon provides customers with an opportunity to rate and review purchases. Individual ratings - called \"star ratings\" - allow purchasers to express their level of satisfaction with a product using a scale of 1 (low rated, low satisfaction) to 5 (highly rated, high satisfaction). Additionally, customers can submit text-based messages - called \"reviews\" - that express further opinions and information about the product. Other customers can submit ratings on these reviews as being helpful or not - called a \"helpfulness rating\" - towards assisting their own product purchasing decision. Companies use these data to gain insights into the markets in which they participate, the timing of that participation, and the potential success of product design feature choices.\n\nSunshine Company is planning to introduce and sell three new products in the online marketplace: a microwave oven, a baby pacifier, and a hair dryer. They have hired your team as consultants to identify key patterns, relationships, measures, and parameters in past customer-supplied ratings and reviews associated with other competing products to 1) inform their online sales strategy and 2) identify potentially important design features that would enhance product desirability. Sunshine Company has used data to inform sales strategies in the past, but they have not previously used this particular combination and type of data. Of particular interest to Sunshine Companyare time-based patterns in these data, and whether they interact in ways that will help the company craft successful products.\n\nTo assist you, Sunshine's data center has provided you with three data files for this project: hair_dryer.tsv, microwave.tsv, and pacifier.tsv. These data represent customer-supplied ratings and reviews for microwave ovens, baby pacifiers, and hair dryers sold in the Amazon marketplace over the time period(s) indicated in the data. A glossary of data label definitions is provided as well. THE DATA FILES PROVIDED CONTAIN THE ONLY DATA YOU SHOULD USE FOR THIS PROBLEM.",
  "problem_requirement": "1. Analyze the three product data sets provided to identify, describe, and support with mathematical evidence, meaningful quantitative and/or qualitative patterns, relationships, measures, and parameters within and between star ratings, reviews, and helpfulness ratings that will help Sunshine Company succeed in their three new online marketplace product offerings.\n\n2. Use your analysis to address the following specific questions and requests from the Sunshine Company Marketing Director:\n\nIdentify data measures based on ratings and reviews that are most informative for Sunshine Company to track, once their three products are placed on sale in the online marketplace.\nIdentify and discuss time-based measures and patterns within each data set that might suggest that a product's reputation is increasing or decreasing in the online marketplace.\nDetermine combinations of text-based measure(s) and ratings-based measures that best indicate a potentially successful or failing product.\nDo specific star ratings incite more reviews? For example, are customers more likely to write some type of review after seeing a series of low star ratings?\nAre specific quality descriptors of text-based reviews such as 'enthusiastic', 'disappointed', and others, strongly associated with rating levels?\n3. Write a one- to two-page letter to the Marketing Director of Sunshine Company summarizing your team's analysis and results. Include specific justification(s) for the result that your team most confidently recommends to the Marketing Director.",
