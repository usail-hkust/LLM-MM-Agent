  "background": "The Great Lakes of the United States and Canada are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world. The five lakes and connecting waterways constitute a massive drainage basin that contains many large urban areas in these two countries, with varied climate and localized weather conditions. The lakes’ water is used for many purposes (fishing, recreation, power generation, drinking, shipping, animal and fish habitat, construction, irrigation, etc.). Consequently, a vast variety of stakeholders have an interest in the management of the water that flows into and out of the lakes. In particular, if too little water is drained or evaporates from the lakes, then flooding may occur and homes and businesses along the shore suffer; if too much water is drained, then large ships cannot travel through the waterways to bring supplies and support the local economy. The main problem is regulating the water levels such that all stakeholders can benefit. The water level in each lake is determined by how much water enters and leaves the lake. These levels are the result of complex interactions among temperature, wind, tides, precipitation, evaporation, bathymetry (the shape of the lake bottom), river flows and runoff, reservoir policies, seasonal cycles, and long-term climate changes. There are two primary control mechanisms within the flow of water in the Great Lakes system – Compensating Works of the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie (three hydropower plants, five navigation locks, and a gated dam at the head of the rapids) and the Moses-Saunders Dam at Cornwall as indicated in the Addendum. While the two control dams, many channels and canals, and the drainage basin reservoirs may be controlled by humans, the rates of rain, evaporation, erosion, ice jams, and other water-flow phenomena are beyond human manipulation. The policies of local jurisdictions may have different effects than expected, as can seasonal and environmental changes in the water basin. These changes in turn affect the ecosystem of the area, which impacts the health of the flora and fauna found in and around the lakes and the residents that live in the water basin. Even though the Great Lakes seem to have a regular annual pattern, a variance from normal of two to three feet of water level can dramatically affect some of the stakeholders. This dynamic network flow problem is “wicked” – exceptionally challenging to solve because of interdependencies, complicated requirements, and inherent uncertainties. For the lake’s problems, we have ever-changing dynamics and the conflicting interests of stakeholders.",
  "problem_requirement": "The International Joint Commission (IJC) requests support from your company, International network Control Modelers – ICM, to assist with management and models for the control mechanisms (the two dams – Compensating Works and Moses-Saunders Dam as indicated in the Addendum) that directly influence water levels in the Great Lakes flow network. Your ICM supervisor has given your team the lead in developing the model and a management plan to implement the model. Your supervisor indicates there are several considerations that may help to achieve this goal starting with the building of a network model for the Great Lakes and connecting river flows from Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean. Some other optional considerations or issues your supervisor mentioned were: 1. Determination of the optimal water levels of the five Great Lakes at any time of the year, taking into account the various stakeholders’ desires (the costs and benefits could be different for each stakeholder). 2. Establishment of algorithms to maintain optimal water levels in the five lakes from inflow and outflow data for the lakes. 3. Understanding of the sensitivity of your control algorithms for the outflow of the two control dams. Given the data for 2017, would your new controls result in satisfactory or better than the actual recorded water levels for the various stakeholders for that year? 4. How sensitive is your algorithm to changes in environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation, winter snowpack, ice jams)? 5. Focus your extensive analysis of ONLY the stakeholders and factors influencing Lake Ontario as there is more recent concern for the management of the water level for this lake. The IJC is also interested in what historical data you use to inform your models and establish parameters, as they are curious to compare how your management and control strategies compare to previous models. Provide a one-page memo to IJC leadership communicating the key features of your model to convince them to select your model.",

  "dataset_description": {"Problem_D_Great_Lakes": "Data for the inflows, outflows, and water levels for the lakes, where the empty values as '---'. It contains 11 sheets. The first sheet is named 'Lake Superior', with data units in meters. The coordinated monthly mean lakewide average water levels are calculated using the coordinated gauge network. For Lake Superior, this consists of: Marquette and Point Iroquois, MI; Duluth, MN; Michipicoten and Thunder Bay, Ontario. The second sheet is named 'St. Mary's River', with data units in cubic meters per second. The St. Mary's River flow at the water level station at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario is provided. Monthly flows are computed as an average of daily calculated flows. The third sheet is named 'Lake Michigan and Lake Huron', with data units in meters. The coordinated monthly mean lakewide average water levels are calculated using the coordinated gauge network. For Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, this consists of: Harbor Beach, Mackinaw City, and Ludington, MI; Milwaukee, WI; Thessalon and Tobermory, Ontario. The fourth sheet is named 'St. Clair River', with data units in cubic meters per second. The St. Clair River flow at the water level station in Port Huron, Michigan is provided. Monthly flows are computed as an average of daily calculated flows. The fifth sheet is named 'Lake St. Clair', with data units in meters. The coordinated monthly mean lakewide average water levels are calculated using the coordinated gauge network. For Lake St. Clair, this consists of: St. Clair Shores, MI, and Belle River, Ontario. The sixth sheet is named 'Detroit River', with data units in cubic meters per second. The Detroit River flow at the water level station in Wayne County, Michigan is provided. Monthly flows are computed as an average of daily calculated flows. The seventh sheet is named 'Lake Erie', with data units in meters. The coordinated monthly mean lakewide average water levels are calculated using the coordinated gauge network. The eighth sheet is named 'Niagara River', with data units in cubic meters per second. The Niagara River flow at Buffalo is calculated as the sum of the component flows diverted to the US and Canadian hydropower plants, locally estimated inflows, Welland River flow, and flow over Niagara Falls. Monthly flows are computed as an average of daily calculated flows. The ninth sheet is named 'Lake Ontario', with data units in meters. The coordinated monthly mean lakewide average water levels are calculated using the coordinated gauge network. For Lake Ontario, this consists of: Oswego and Rochester, NY; Cobourg, Port Weller, Toronto, and Kingston, Ontario. The tenth sheet is named 'Ottawa River', with data units in cubic meters per second. The Ottawa River has 50 major dams and hydro-electric generating stations and links with 13 large reservoirs. These reservoirs store a significant portion of the spring runoff to reduce downstream (mainly Montreal harbor) flooding. Carillion is the last observation station along the Ottawa River before the water flows into the St. Lawrence River. The eleventh sheet is named 'St. Lawrence River', with data units in cubic meters per second. The St. Lawrence River flow at the water level station at Cornwall, Ontario is provided. Daily data is available, and data presented is from the first day of each month."},
