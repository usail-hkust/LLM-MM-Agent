  "background": "Many companies view data as a strategic asset but acknowledge great difficulty deriving value from this asset. Proper management of this precious resource can lead to a competitive advantage. Thus, companies need to establish an integrated data and analytics (D&A) system, where they can guarantee that they have the right people, technologies, and processes in place to manage, manipulate, use, and protect this resource. Your consulting team develops models that evaluate D&A systems to help company executives make the right decisions pertaining to three key components: people, technologies, and processes. When it comes to D&A, your models provide companies with the ability to measure the D&A system maturity through examination of these three key components. To maximize the potential of their data assets, companies want highly skilled people, relevant technologies, mature processes, and a strong connection between all three components. Your models help companies assess their current state and provide insight into the system changes needed to maximize the potential of their D&A system. Companies use your model(s) to optimize their analytic capabilities, obtain a competitive advantage, and give customers confidence in the company’s ability to manage data. Intercontinental Cargo Moving (ICM) Corporation operates a large seaport and has hired your team. ICM Corporation wants you to measure the maturity of their current D&A system and provide a solid plan to optimize their D&A capabilities. Using your model, ICM Corporation hopes to instill customer trust and confidence in their data practices.",
  "problem_requirement": "Due to company regulations, ICM Corporation is unable to share specifics about their people, technologies, processes, or data with your team. However, a general description of ICM Corporation’s operations and the types of data that they deal with on a regular basis is included below on page 3. Develop a model to evaluate the D&A system of ICM Corporation. Your model development and report should include the following: 1. A metric to measure the current D&A system maturity level for ICM Corporation. Include key performance indicators that measure the success of their D&A people, technologies, and processes. 2. After ICM Corporation uses your model to determine their current D&A maturity level, demonstrate how they could use your model to recommend changes to the system allowing the company to maximize the potential of their data assets. 3. Suggest protocols that ICM should put in place to measure the effectiveness of their D&A system. Demonstrate how your model might be applied to a larger or smaller seaport. Analyze how your system maturity metric could be adapted to other industries. Specifically, could a trucking company use your maturity metric? If customers of ICM Corporation, like a trucking company, also used your metric, how could this benefit ICM Corporation? Ultimately, the ICM Corporation cares about customer satisfaction and confidence. Write a one page letter to ICM Corporation’s customers (the port users) outlining your proposed methods of measurement and instilling confidence in ICM Corporation’s D&A system.",
