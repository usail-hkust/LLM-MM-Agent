  "background": "The United Nations (UN) has set 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Achieving these goals would ultimately lead to an improved life for many people around the world. These goals are not independent of each other. So, often positive gains in some goals have an impact (positive or negative and sometimes both) on other goals. This interconnectedness makes the achievement of all goals a fluid process where funding limitations and other national and international priorities may take precedence. Additionally, the impact of technological advances, global pandemics, climate change, regional wars, and refugee movements have had serious implications on many of the goals.",
  "problem_requirement": "To explore the relationships between the goals: 1. Create a network of the relationships between the 17 SDGs. 2. Use the individual SDGs, as well as the structure of your network, to set priorities that can most efficiently move the work of the UN forward. How did you evaluate the effectiveness of each priority? What could be reasonable to achieve in the next 10 years if your priorities are initiated? 3. If one of the SDGs is achieved (for example, there is no poverty or no hunger), what would be the structure of the resulting network? How would this achievement impact your team’s priorities? Are there other goals that should be included or proposed to the UN for inclusion? 4. Discuss the impact of technological advances, global pandemics, climate change, regional wars, and refugee movements, or other international crises on your team’s network and your team’s choice of priorities. What are the significant effects on the progress of the UN from a network perspective? 5. Discuss how your network approach may help other companies and organizations set priorities of their goals.
