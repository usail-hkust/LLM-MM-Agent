  "background": "Like many luxury goods, sailboats vary in value as they age and as market conditions change. The attached “2023_MCM_Problem_Y_Boats.xlsx” file includes data on approximately 3500 sailboats from 36 to 56 feet long advertised for sale in Europe, the Caribbean, and the USA in December 2020. A boating enthusiast provided these data to COMAP. Like most real-world data sets, it may have missing data or other issues that require some data cleaning prior to analysis. The Excel file includes two tabs, one for monohulled sailboats and one for catamarans. In each tab, columns are labeled Make, Variant, Length (in feet), Geographic Region, Country/Region/State, Listing Price (in US dollars), and Year (of manufacture). For a given make, variant, and year, there are many other sources beyond the provided Excel file that may provide detailed descriptions of the features of a particular sailboat. You may supplement the data set provided with any additional data you choose; however, you must include the data in “2023_MCM_Problem_Y_Boats.xlsx” in your modeling. Be sure to fully identify and document the source of any supplemental data used.  ",
  "problem_requirement": "Sailboats are frequently sold through brokers. In a desire to better understand the sailboat market, one sailboat broker in Hong Kong (SAR), China has commissioned your team to prepare a report on the pricing of used sailboats. The broker would like you to: 1. Develop a mathematical model that explains the listing price of each of the sailboats in the provided spreadsheet. Include any predictors you consider useful. You may draw on other sources to understand additional features of a given sailboat (such as beam, draft, displacement, rigging, sail area, hull materials, engine hours, sleeping capacity, headroom, electronics, etc.) and for economic data by year and region. Identify and describe all sources of data used. Include a discussion of the precision of your estimate for each sailboat variant’s price. 2. Use your model to explain the effect, if any, of region on listing prices. Discuss whether any regional effect is consistent across all sailboat variants. Address the practical and statistical significance of any regional effects noted. 3. Discuss how your modeling of the given geographic regions can be useful in the Hong Kong (SAR) market. Choose an informative subset of sailboats, split between monohulls and catamarans, from the provided spreadsheet. Find comparable listing price data for that subset from the Hong Kong (SAR) market. Model what the regional effect of Hong Kong (SAR) would be, if there is one, on each of the sailboat prices for the sailboats in your subset. Is the effect the same for both catamarans and monohull sailboats? 4. Identify and discuss any other interesting and informative inferences or conclusions your team draws from the data. 5. Prepare a one- to two-page report for the Hong Kong (SAR) sailboat broker. Include a few well-chosen graphics to help the broker understand your conclusions.",
