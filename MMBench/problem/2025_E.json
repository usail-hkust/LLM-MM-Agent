    "background": "A forest filled with towering trees and diverse wildlife was cleared to make way for agriculture. The once-thriving ecosystem, home to birds, insects, and animals, vanished and in its place, rows of crops were planted. The land began to change – soil that once held the richness of nature became depleted, and pests began to invade the crops. To combat this, the farmers turned to chemicals, but the balance of the land was disrupted. With this shift, the intricate web of life that had flourished in the forest was broken, and a new, human-driven cycle of agriculture took its place creating a new food web based on an agricultural ecosystem. In an established agricultural system, there are bats, birds and other species but to get there, the ecosystem must mature.",
    "problem_requirement": "Model and Analyze: In places throughout the world, scenarios like this one occur. As a member of the Consideration of Mature Agricultural Practices (COMAP) group, you have been asked to construct a model to track habitat change from forest-to-farm. Your supervisor has given your team the lead in determining how a converted forest area can change over time as the ecosystem evolves along with accompanying agricultural choices. Your supervisor wants the analysis to include both natural processes as well as human decisions. Therefore, you should start your model of a newly cleared converted forest area ecosystem and track the model through stages of change due to the changes in species in addition to the many impacts of farming practices. You can make assumptions to build a situation of forest-to-farm, or you can use data and information from stages in a real historic sample of this kind of evolution. You may want to consider the following in your analysis: \n\n- Natural Processes \n• Model the current ecosystem. Build a basic food web model for this new agricultural ecosystem which recently took the place of a heavily forested region. Include the producers and the consumers as well as the impact of the agriculture cycleand its seasonality which changes the system dynamics over time. Consider the impact of herbicides and pesticides by including the effects of chemical use on plant health, insect populations, bat and bird populations as well as the ecosystem stability. \n• Incorporate the reemergence of species. Over time, the edge habitats begin to mature which brings back the species native to the area. As species return, the agricultural ecosystem changes due to the interactions of these species with the current environment. Incorporate two different species into the model to determine the impacts.\n\n- Human Decisions \n• Removal of herbicide. As the ecosystem matures, farmers may attempt to remove some of the chemical dependance.o If the herbicide was removed, report on the stability of the ecosystem in terms of the producers and consumers.o Bring the ecosystem back into balance by incorporating bats into the food web model. Model bats as insectivores that control pest populations and as pollinators that support plant reproduction. Consider how bats' interactions with insects, plants, and predators influence the overall stability of the ecosystem. Identify another species that can provide benefits to bring the ecosystem back into balance and compare the impacts.\n• Go green? Analyze the implications of a farmer considering organic farming methods.Consideration should be given to different scenarios with varying components of organic farming. Demonstrate the impact on the ecosystem as a whole and to the individual components. Discuss aspects such as pest control, crop health, plant reproduction, biodiversity, long-term sustainability and cost effectiveness. \n\nShare Your Insights • Include a one-page letter to a farmer who is exploring organic farming practices. • Advise the farmer on what methods should be employed including discussions on economic trade-offs as well as sustainability. Help the farmer determine strategies that could be implemented to balance costs and sustainability and how advocating for certain policies could incentivize this type of conservation in agriculture.",
